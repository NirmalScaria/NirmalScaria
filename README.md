Hi 👋 Thanks for stopping by!

I create and maintain some of the open source tools you might be using. Over a thousand commits went behind projects like [le-git-graph](https://github.com/NirmalScaria/le-git-graph) and [firebase-nextjs](https://github.com/NirmalScaria/firebase-nextjs).

You could sponsor me to help me keep maintaining and improving these features, and contribute more towards open source.

I’m also available for hire! Feel free to reach out at:
scaria@scaria.dev

Update: I am no longer available for hire (for the good). I got a job at Amazon!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
